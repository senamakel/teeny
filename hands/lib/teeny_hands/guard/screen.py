"""The lexical screen: does this text contain a word the account does not
touch? Deterministic, synchronous, no model. It runs on everything coming
in and everything going out, and it cannot be argued with, because it is
not listening. A port of `crates/teeny-safety/src/screen.rs` (itself
`legacy/src/safety/screen.ts`).

The Rust emulated the legacy one-character lookarounds on a regex engine
without them (`bounded.rs`); Python's `re` is the backtracker the legacy
patterns were written for, so they are used as written.
